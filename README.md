## Dependencies

None.

## Installing

No additional installation is required.
Just run the command on Git CLI "git clone".

## Executing program

Live-server is recommended.

## Images

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Have fun with JavaScript!
